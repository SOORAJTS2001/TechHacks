# TechHacks



Welcome to today's tech hack challenge! You have three files:

1. `key`: A mysterious key file.
2. `lock`: A locked file containing a hidden "Surprise inside."
3. `monalisa.png`: An image file that may hide "Snake's secrets in plain bytes."

Follow these steps to unlock the secrets:

### Step 1: Decipher the Key

Uncover the contents of the `key` file, byte by byte. Use this information to unlock the `lock`.

### Step 2: Unlock the "Surprise Inside"

Apply the knowledge obtained from the `key` file to unlock the `lock`. Discover the hidden "Surprise inside."

### Step 3: Decrypt the Image

Investigate the `monalisa.png` image. Could it contain "Snake's secrets in plain bytes"?

### Step 4: Combine the Flags

Once you've successfully retrieved the flags from the `lock` and the `monalisa.png` image, combine them into a single message. Share your findings in the chat box.

Have fun uncovering the hidden secrets!
